AsteroidsGame
=============

Space shooter game

Was a team school project and I got a little bit carried away, 

Architecture of the game is seen so it's easy to create new IA's, 
enemies, Levels...

So I'm gonna list what has been done : 
-Camera 2D
-POO for Asteroids,
  -enemies
  -IA's
  -Weapons
  -Shields
  ...
  
And what is actually needed : 
-Particle system (on GPU)
-Flockin IA
-more IA (Path finding)
-Level Editor
-Paralax and other graphics ameliorations
-Level Desing
-Weapon desing
-Shield desing
-Lightning effects
-Implementing a better hittest system (the present one is homeMade)
-...

Please add whatever you want to the code, 
I'm actually looking for some one intersted in making this a real good game so if your interster tell me! (Dargonesti)
